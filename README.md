# Coulex Calculation Code

At the moment, this program is able to calculate the safe distance of closest approach and model the distance of closest approach between a projectile and a target nucleus in a Coulomb excitation experiment. Given inputs such as projectile and target masses, charges, beam energy, and scattering angle range, it determines whether the experimental setup maintains a safe distance to avoid nuclear contact. It also optionally computes and plots the Rutherford scattering differential cross-section against scattering angle, as well as the safe impact parameter related to the scattering angle, helping users understand the interaction dynamics and experimental constraints. 'h' for Help.

Future aims of this code, will include other calculations involved in Coulomb exitation experiments, in hopes of interpretating results and parameters easier.
