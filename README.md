# Coulex Calculation Code

This program calculates and visualizes the safe distance of closest approach in a Coulomb excitation experiment between a projectile and a target nucleus. Given inputs such as projectile and target masses, charges, beam energy, and scattering angle range, it determines whether the experimental setup maintains a safe distance to avoid nuclear contact. It also optionally computes and plots the Rutherford scattering differential cross-section and impact parameter related to the scattering angles, helping users understand the interaction dynamics and experimental constraints. 'h' for Help.
