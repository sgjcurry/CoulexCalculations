# Coulex Calculation Code

At the moment, this program is able to calculate the safe distance of closest approach and model the distance of closest approach between a projectile and a target nucleus in a Coulomb excitation experiment. Given inputs such as projectile and target masses, charges, beam energy, and scattering angle range, it determines whether the experimental setup maintains a safe distance to avoid nuclear contact.
